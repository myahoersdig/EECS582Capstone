EECS 582 Capstone

How do I run the project? (as of now):
  1. download android studio (https://developer.android.com/studio)
  2. clone this repo into android studio
  3. you can click the run button at the top to run the app, the android emulator might take a second to build
    i. if you have to to choose a type of device, any should be fine but PIE is good to test on olderish devices

you can commit in android studio!! (you dont have to use it though)
all i ask is if you commit, create a new branch with a description of the work done and then we can merge at the end
